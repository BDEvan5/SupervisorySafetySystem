test_data = read.csv("PaperTable.csv")
library(ggplot2)

```

# Tests

## Repeatability

We evaluate 10 agents of the baseline and the SSS.

```{r}

test_data %>%
  filter(EvalName=="BaselineComp")%>%
  select(avg_times, success_rate, test_number, reward, kernel_reward, vehicle, test_number) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=vehicle, y=(avg_times), color=test_number))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()

```

The tests show that the SSS produces much more similar results than the baseline agent.
The standard deviation of the data is much smaller at ... vs ...

The average times produced by the SSS is also lower, showing that the SSS leads to faster racing behaviour.
